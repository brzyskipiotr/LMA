The Loan Market Association is the authoritative voice of the loan markets across Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Our mission is to advance liquidity, efficiency, transparency and sustainability. The LMA Edge Hackathon invites a diverse mix of participants, from loan markets novice to subject matter expert, from fledgeling web developer to technology wizard, to reimagine how loans are originated, documented, traded and managed.

This hackathon is a call to build commercially viable, desktop-based prototypes, wireframes, or applications. The LMA website and our many LinkedIn posts can help you understand current practices, uncover pain points, and ideate bold solutions. With $25,000 USD in prizes, we’re looking for high-impact, scalable ideas that align with our values and our mission. If you’re motivated to apply technical creativity and cross-disciplinary thinking to a multi-trillion dollar market, this is your moment to shine.
